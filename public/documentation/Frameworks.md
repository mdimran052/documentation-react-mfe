## Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).

### Sample Code
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## .Net
.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, gaming, and IoT.

### Sample Code
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Python
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

### Sample Code
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
